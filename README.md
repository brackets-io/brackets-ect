# Brackets-ECT

**ðŸš§ Caution:** It's a fork of [brackets-eco](https://github.com/SteveMcArthur/brackets-eco) by @SteveMcArthur, you may follow it up. I added a basic support of ECT.js systax to have better highlighting but I am not longer maintaining this repository. 

Thank you for visiting. Although, fell free to contact me ðŸ˜‰
